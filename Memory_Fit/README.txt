# Process Scheduling
---
Process scheduling is a crucial aspect of operating systems that determines the order and allocation of CPU time to different processes. It involves selecting a process from the ready queue and dispatching it for execution on the CPU. The scheduler employs various algorithms to achieve efficient and fair resource utilization, such as First-Come, First-Served (FCFS), Shortest Job Next (SJN), Round Robin (RR), or Priority Scheduling. The goal is to optimize system throughput, response time, and fairness while ensuring the smooth execution of concurrent processes.
